## Non-robust features: 

​	humanly imperceptible features, but of high prediction power



## Adversarial vulnerability: 

​	models’ sensitivity to well-generalizing (non-robust) features in the data

​	*not tied to the training framework



## Adversarial transferability: 

​	adversarial perturbations computed for one model transfer to other independently trained models

​	

## Robust Model (1)

possible to remove non-robust features from a dataset



## Non-Robust Model (2)

possible to accentuate only the non-robust features in a dataset
